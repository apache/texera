The first page this unlocks is the\nbenchmark dashboard generated under `dev/bench`, so benchmark results\ncan be inspected at a stable web URL instead of only through short-lived\nGitHub Actions artifacts.\n\nThe root Pages path is set explicitly because ASF `.asf.yaml` defaults\n`ghp_path` to `/docs` when it is omitted, while the existing dashboard\nfiles are generated at `gh-pages:/dev/bench`.\n\n### Any related issues, documentation, discussions?\nCloses #5636\n\n### How was this PR tested?\nConfiguration-only change; no unit tests were added.\n\n```bash\nruby -e \"require %q(yaml); YAML.load_file(%q(.asf.yaml)); puts %q(YAML OK)\"\ngit diff --check\n```\n\n### Was this PR authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\nGenerated-by: Codex (GPT-5)",
